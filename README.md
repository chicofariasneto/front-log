### Goals

First of all, just to be clear, my intent is study frontend and learn some frameworks. Since I'm a backend developer, I would like to improve and learn front-end technologies, so I drew a list of content to help during this process.

#### Web Developing

1. .HTML5 and .CSS
2. Spring Boot (Java, front-end Side)
3. React.JS
4. Angular
5 Vue.JS (Maybe, I don't have sure)

#### Mobile Developing

1. React Native
2. Flutter
